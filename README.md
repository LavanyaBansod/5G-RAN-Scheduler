# 5G-RAN-Scheduler

A Reinforcement  Learning-Based Approach to Energy-Efficient  Resource Allocation

The **5G RAN Scheduler Project** is an intelligent solution for optimizing resource allocation in 5G Radio Access Networks (RANs). By leveraging **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithms, it dynamically adjusts transmission power to achieve energy efficiency while maintaining high throughput. Built using the **OpenAI Gym** framework, this project provides a realistic simulation of 5G network scenarios, enabling rigorous evaluation of advanced scheduling strategies.  

## Features  
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Dynamically optimizes transmission power per resource block for energy-efficient operations.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements Q-Learning (off-policy) and SARSA (on-policy) algorithms for decision-making.  
- **OpenAI Gym Environment**: Simulates realistic 5G RAN conditions, including resource usage, power levels, and network states.  
- **Metrics Optimization**: Balances energy consumption and throughput for better network performance.
